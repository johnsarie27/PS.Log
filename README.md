PS.Log is a lightweight PowerShell module for structured trace logging. It provides a consistent set of log levels — `Info`, `Warn`, `Error`, and `Debug` — with no external dependencies, making it suitable for use inside secure or air-gapped environments. Compatible with Windows PowerShell 5.1 and PowerShell Core.

## Installation

PS.Log is not published to the PowerShell Gallery. Install it by cloning the repository:

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/johnsarie27/PS.Log.git
Import-Module ./PS.Log/PS.Log.psd1
```

To make the module available in all sessions, copy the module folder to a path in `$env:PSModulePath`:

```powershell
Copy-Item -Path ./PS.Log -Destination "$HOME\Documents\PowerShell\Modules\PS.Log" -Recurse
```

## Usage

`Start-Log` creates the log file and returns its full path. Pass that path to every subsequent call.

```powershell
Import-Module PS.Log

$logPath = Start-Log -Directory "C:\Logs" -Name "app"
Write-LogInfo  -Path $logPath -Message "Application started"
Write-LogWarn  -Path $logPath -Message "Low disk space detected"
Write-LogError -Path $logPath -Message "Connection failed"
Write-LogDebug -Path $logPath -Message "Retrying in 5 seconds"
Stop-Log -Path $logPath
```
